## FARS Package

FARS is an Accident Data Analysis R package developped in the 3rd course of the
["Mastering Software Development in R Specialization"](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/r) by Johns Hopkins University on Coursera: ["Building R Packages"](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/r) 

#### Instructions

The purpose of this assessment is for you to combine your skills of creating, writing, documenting, and testing an R package with releasing that package on GitHub. In this assessment you'll be taking the R files from Week 2's assessment about documentation and putting that file in an R package.

The functions provided for you in this assignment will be using data from the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's [Fatality Analysis Reporting System](https://one.nhtsa.gov/Data/Fatality-Analysis-Reporting-System-(FARS)), which is a nationwide census providing the American public yearly data regarding fatal injuries suffered in motor vehicle traffic crashes.
